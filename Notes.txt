Ansconmbe's Quartet

The essence of the implementation of the Anscombe's Quertet is intended to counter the impression among statisticians that "numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough."


In ranking encoding, positon (x and y planes) come first, in scale of importance, while color density comes last. This is because of their relative nature in displaying the most important information, ina set of data

The ranking are this:
	Position
	Length
	Angle and slope
	Area
	Volume
	Density
	
	
	Rickshaw Dimple NVD3
	Chargind Dell XPS with usb type C
	
	
	Data to Display Elements
	Data Display
	
	Exploratory Data analysis is used to deduce information about a set of data, for one's self, while in data visualization, one tries to convey information about a piece of data, to others
	
	
	The enter() method is used to create a new element or DOM node for each piece of data in a dataset




var r = d3.scale.sqrt().domain([52070, 1380000000]).range([10,50]);





 const canvas = d3.select("main")
            .append("svg")
            .attr("width", "500")
            .attr("height", "300")
            .style("border", "1px solid silver")

            canvas.append("circle")
            .attr("cx", x(15))
            .attr("cy", y(49))
            .attr("fill", "teal")
            .attr("r", r(52070))

            canvas.append("circle")
            .attr("cx", x(25))
            .attr("cy", y(78))
            .attr("fill", "blue")
            .attr("r", r(52090))
          console.log(y(45))


The text method also accepts a callback function as argument
The function reveives the value under operation, and can carry
out certain logic based on the value

The Style() method also accepts a callback function as argument,
and can perform similay logic with the value it receives from 
the callback function

Setting Of Canvas Width and height
Setting up scale for X and Y
Append SVG with set width and height
Append Shapes co-ordinate with value for their co-ordinates scaled
Set up Axis using the required D3 methods
Append Axis



1. Access data
2. Create dimensions
3. Draw canvas
4. Create scales
5. Draw data
6. Draw peripherals
7. Set up interactions

Our wrapper is the whole size of the entire chart entity, comprising of the axes
and labels too..

Our bounds consists only the part of the chart, where the diagram is diaplayed
